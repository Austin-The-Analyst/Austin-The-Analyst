## 👋 Hi, I'm Austin Benjamin (aka Snowice)

## About Me
I'm a passionate Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Developer, and AI Enthusiast from Nigeria 🇳🇬. With a solid background in Python, SQL (SSMS & MySQL), Power BI, and Tableau, I love transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions.

🔍 Over the years, I’ve built ETL pipelines, predictive models, and interactive dashboards that support business growth, improve performance, and enable data-driven thinking. I’ve also worked on end-to-end projects in data analytics, machine learning, and automation.

⚡ I'm the founder of 4thMan Solutions, where I lead projects around AI-powered trading systems, data education, and fintech innovation. I'm also building AI bots, Telegram signal systems, and deploying full-scale trading automation solutions with live dashboards and VPS integration.

🎯 My mission is to leverage data and technology to create scalable solutions that empower individuals and organizations — and eventually help transform Nigeria’s tech ecosystem.
